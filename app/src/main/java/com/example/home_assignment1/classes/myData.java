    public static String[] nameArray = {"Rachel Green", "Ross Geller", "Monica Geller", "Chandler Bing", "Joey Tribbiani",
            "Phoebe Buffay", "Janice Hosenstein", "Mike Hannigan", "Frank Buffay Jr.", "Gunther"};

    public static String[] descriptionArray = {"Rachel starts off as a spoiled, self-centered runaway bride who has never worked a day in her life. Over the course of the series, she grows into a confident and independent woman with a successful career in fashion. Her on-and-off relationship with Ross is one of the central storylines, and despite her initial lack of direction, she ultimately becomes one of the most grounded characters.",
    "Ross is a lovable but awkward paleontologist who is deeply passionate about science (and being right). He’s known for his many failed marriages and for being overly dramatic, especially about his love life—most notably his complicated relationship with Rachel. Despite his quirks and neuroses, Ross is caring and intelligent, with a soft spot for his friends and family.",
    "Monica is Ross’s younger sister, a professional chef with a strong competitive streak and a need for control. She is incredibly organized, a clean freak, and often acts as the “mom” of the group. Her childhood struggle with obesity and need to prove herself drive her perfectionism. Monica eventually finds love and stability with Chandler, whom she marries and later adopts twins with.",
    "Chandler is known for his quick wit and sarcastic humor, often used to mask his emotional insecurities. He works in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration—though no one really knows what that means. Despite his struggles with commitment and a complicated family background, Chandler matures significantly through the series, eventually becoming a devoted husband and father.",
    "Joey is a struggling actor with a big heart, a love for food (especially pizza), and a not-so-bright intellect. His role as Dr. Drake Ramoray on Days of Our Lives is his biggest career highlight. He’s known for his loyalty, charm, and famous pick-up line, “How you doin’?” Though not the smartest of the group, Joey’s sincerity and childlike innocence make him incredibly lovable.",
    "Phoebe is the group’s quirky, free-spirited masseuse and folk singer. She has a bizarre past, including living on the streets and a twin sister named Ursula. Her offbeat personality, strange beliefs, and unique musical talents (like her song “Smelly Cat”) make her one of the most unpredictable and endearing characters. Despite her eccentricities, Phoebe is deeply loyal and surprisingly wise.",
    "Janice is Chandler’s ex-girlfriend, instantly recognizable by her nasal voice and catchphrase, “Oh. My. God.” She frequently reappears in the group’s lives at the most unexpected times. Though annoying to the main cast, Janice is actually a well-meaning and affectionate person who just can’t seem to stay away.",
    "Mike is introduced as Phoebe’s love interest and eventually becomes her husband. He’s laid-back, charming, and good-natured, perfectly balancing Phoebe’s eccentricities. A pianist with a love for the simple things, Mike is one of the few people who fully embraces Phoebe for who she is.",
    "Frank Jr. is Phoebe’s half-brother, an odd and goofy character with a big heart. He’s passionate about his unusual hobbies (like melting things) and ends up marrying his high school teacher. Phoebe later helps him by becoming a surrogate for his triplets, showing the strong bond they share despite not growing up together.",
    "Gunther is the bleach-blonde barista at Central Perk with an unspoken (and unrequited) love for Rachel. Though mostly in the background, his deadpan expressions and subtle jealousy of Ross provide consistent comic relief. He’s awkward, loyal, and endearing in his quiet obsession with Rachel."
